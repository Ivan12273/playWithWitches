# Play with Witches (or better not)
My personal game project

This is a demo I did for learning, I will continue the project in a new version of Unity reusing all the desings of this project, I´m still planning the game mechanics.
I made all the sprites in aseprite and also the functionalities of the game. I´m thinking on a better name for the game, maybe I will choose a friendlier one, this is too dark haha.

## Mechacnics
The basic idea is that it be an open world game where the protagonist must go through cursed places and corners to collect objects that will serve her to reach her final goal.
What is the final goal? well, that's still a mystery.

## Design
A little demonstration of the game.

### Protagonist
I was inspired by games like Earthbound and Yume Nikki, I made different designs for the protagonist, the third one is the one I liked the most, the idea is that the character has an inventory, so the backpack is a good additive to justify where she carries her objects.

### Secundary characters
The idea of the mirror is that the protagonist can talk with him to receive advice or teleport to other worlds, the mirror is alive and has its own personality, he is not very friendly so to get his help the protagonist needs to give him something in return.

A generic demon is the first "paranormal" interaction with the protagonist, it's scary but not so dangerous.

### Objects and room
These are the objects that I designed for the protagonist's room, there is also the color of the walls and the floor.
Below I describe each of the objects and the function I have in mind for them.
- Door: Well, it's a door, the protagonist can go out through it.
- Diary: Here the player can see information related to their progress in the game.
- Bed: In real life for sleep, in video games for save the game (or at least in this one).
- Bookcase: I have the idea that in the bookcase the player can see interesting information about the game world.

### Map of the house
The architecture of the protagonist's house, may have changes in the future.

## Posible characters
Characters that I designed a long time ago, it occurred to me that I might add them to the video game in the future.
